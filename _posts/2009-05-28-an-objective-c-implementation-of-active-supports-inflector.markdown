title: An Objective-C implementation of ActiveSupport's Inflector
categories: [objective-c, active-support, inflector]

Over the last week I've been playing with Objective-C, for fun rather than profit.  Here's the first result of this dabbling - [an Objective-C implementation](http://github.com/tomafro/ActiveSupportInflector/tree/master) of ActiveSupport's pluralize and singularize methods.  

It's my first piece of code in the language, so I'd appreciate comments and feedback.
